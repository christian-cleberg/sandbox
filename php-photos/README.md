# php-photos
A simple way to get your photos up onto a dynamic PHP photo gallery.

## Environment
[View the website here.](https://cleberg.io/sandbox/php-photos/)

### Requirements
1. A hosting provider such as Namecheap that allows you to server dynamic websites. GitHub/GitLab pages will not work since PHP is a backend language that won't work with static hosting.
2. The permissions/ability to create folders and files on your hosting provider's server.

### Instructions
Here's the fastest way to get started:
1. Navigate to the folder you want to have your site. E.g. Namecheap sites are in the `public_html` folder, so you could create a `gallery` folder in there to server this site at `example.com/gallery`.
2. Copy the `index.php` and `thumbnails.php` into that folder.
3. Create an `images` folder and put your images in there.
